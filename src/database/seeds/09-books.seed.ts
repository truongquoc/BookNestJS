          "<p>Over the past thirty years, our ideas about the cultures of Empire have been transformed. Contemporary reflections on Empire by writers and artists are widely published and displayed, and museums have witnessed a growing number of exhibitions devoted to aspects of the rich and varied visual culture that emerged in places under British governance, from the Americas to India and Australasia. And yet, since the vast Imperial exhibitions of the early twentieth-century there has been no wide-ranging presentation of the objects made across the British Empire. This publication, which accompanies a major Tate Britain exhibition, fills that gap. Through broad groupings within thematic chapters - Mapping, Collecting, History, Portraiture, Cultural Exchange and the Return of Empire - leading scholars focus on how particular objects tell the history of life under British rule. Paintings by well-known artists such as John Singer Sargent and Sidney Nolan are illustrated alongside Benin bronze heads and Mughal miniatures in a survey that ranges from sixteenth century colonialism through to the projection of Britain's imperial might in the late nineteenth century to its decline in the post-war era. Exploring how artists have represented and critiqued the diverse places, people and events that make up the legacy of Empire, our expert authors have created a vital book on a subject of broad contemporary interest.</p>",

It is a thrilling achievement and will confirm for critics and readers that Catton is one of the brightest stars in the international writing firmament.</p>',

Specially commissioned photography by Benjamin Graham (UK Landscape Photographer of the Year 2017) brings the story to life in vivid portraits of London Underground's stations, tunnels and trains.</p>",

          "<p><strong>A celebration of one of the most important groups of Renaissance paintings</strong>  <br> Titian (active 1506-1576) produced a masterful group of paintings for Philip II of Spain, celebrating the loves of gods, goddesses, and mortals. Depicting scenes from Ovid's narrative poem Metamorphoses, Titian named them 'poesie' and considered the works as visual equivalents of poetry. This volume presents a detailed study of the complete series-Danae, Venus and Adonis, Perseus and Andromeda, Diana and Actaeon, Diana and Callisto, and The Rape of Europa, as well as The Death of Actaeon-lavishly illustrated with details of these emotionally charged paintings. The book explores Titian's creative process and technique, in addition to his use of literary and visual sources and his correspondence with Philip II. The artistic legacy of the series for later European painting is also examined in the works of artists such as Rubens, Velazquez, and Rembrandt. Offering the most comprehensive overview of these remarkable works, Titian: Love, Desire, Death is an indispensable resource for scholars and admirers of Renaissance painting. </p> ",

The worlds of Milan, Rome and Naples through which Caravaggio moved and which Andrew Graham-Dixon describes brilliantly in this book, are those of cardinals and whores, prayer and violence. On the streets surrounding the churches and palaces, brawls and swordfights were regular occurrences. In the course of this desperate life Caravaggio created the most dramatic paintings of his age, using ordinary men and women - often prostitutes and the very poor - to model for his depictions of classic religious scenes. Andrew Graham-Dixon's exceptionally illuminating readings of Caravaggio'spictures, which are the heart of the book, show very clearly how he created their drama, immediacy and humanity, and how completely he departed from the conventions of his time.  </p> ",

Cricket is a sport noted for the richness of its literature, yet despite all that has been written on the great game there remains a yawning gap - where are all the women? This omission may have been understandable in the early and middle part of the last century, when women's cricket existed in a twilight world, regarded as a sport for ladies who could perhaps be most tactfully described as 'unconventional'.But times have changed, and Izzy Duncan's groundbreaking book comes on the scene not a moment too soon.We begin in the late eighteenth century, when ladies made their first mark on cricket amid frantic betting and rowdy crowds. Then on to the highs and lows of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, culminating in the contemporary superstars dominating world cricket and on the cusp of going professional. Tracing the history of the ladies' game, delving into its sometimes murky past and revealing its recent explosion in popularity, Skirting the Boundary is a humorous, charming portrayal of one of the fastest-growing global sports.  </p> ",

As the distinction between reality and fantasy blurs, Clare finds grounding in memories of her childhood in Florida and of her marriage to Richard, revealing her role in his death and reappearance along the way.

The city itself is a character--vibrant and postapocalyptic, flat and featureless except for its rivers, its lakes, its legions of bicyclists. Here in Berlin she encounters a people's history: the Cuban teen taken as a POW on a German submarine only to return home to a family who doesn't believe him; the young Jewish scholar hidden in a sarcophagus until safe passage to England is found; the female lawyer haunted by a childhood of deprivation in the bombed-out suburbs of Berlin who still defends those accused of war crimes; a young nurse with a checkered past who joins the Reich at a medical facility more intent to dispense with the wounded than to heal them; and the son of a zookeeper at the Berlin Zoo, fighting to keep the animals safe from both war and an increasingly starving populace.<br> A meditation on war and mystery, this an exciting new work by one of our most gifted novelists, one that seeks to align the stories of the past with the stories of the future. </p> ",

In wrestling with the question of what a free life is, many young black women created forms of intimacy and kinship indifferent to the dictates of respectability and outside the bounds of law. They cleaved to and cast off lovers, exchanged sex to subsist, and revised the meaning of marriage. Longing and desire fueled their experiments in how to live. They refused to labor like slaves or to accept degrading conditions of work. Here, for the first time, these women are credited with shaping a cultural movement that transformed the urban landscape. Through a melding of history and literary imagination, Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments recovers these women's radical aspirations and insurgent desires.  </p> ",

Brown's poetic concerns are both broad and intimate, and at their very core a distillation of the incredibly human: What is safety? Who is this nation? Where does freedom truly lie? Brown makes mythical pastorals to question the terrors to which we've become accustomed, and to celebrate how we survive. Poems of fatherhood, legacy, blackness, queerness, worship, and trauma are propelled into stunning clarity by Brown's mastery, and his invention of the duplex--a combination of the sonnet, the ghazal, and the blues--is testament to his formal skill. The Tradition is a cutting and necessary collection, relentless in its quest for survival while reveling in a celebration of contradiction. </p> ",

But when she learns that Drayton may have been living under an assumed name, Rachel begins to understand why Khattak is tip-toeing around this case. It soon comes to light that Drayton may have been a war criminal with ties to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995.</p> ",

          '<p>  SLINGSHOT begins with the author ensconced in the menacing isolation of the pastoral, but once the work migrates to the City, monstrum grows form and fangs. In these messy, horny, desperate poems spun from dream logic, Cyrée Jarelle Johnson considers the consequences of black sexual and gender deviance, as well as the emotional burden of being forced to the rim of society, then punished for what keeps you alive. </p> ',
